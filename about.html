<h1> Hello my name is Anthony Emeka Umezinwa. I am a Nigerian American who loves science and anything related to technology. This is my first time ever making a webpage portfolio so I wanted to make it special by adding my twist and my take on it LOL. My  educational background revolves around chemistry and biology but I have alwasy been fascinated with learning foreign languages and engineering. One of my favorite movies is Iron Man 1, because I got to see the genius behind Tony Stark when he built his suit. So here I am now working on computer coding and web development, which I believe is truly awesome. So if I dont get into the program I still plan on honing my skills in coding and web development so that I can bring something different into the world, something revolutionary. </h1>
